# Concept: Permissioned News Subscriptions

This is a concept for a permissioned news subscriptions system.
One envisioned application is in sharing health information, especially for transmissible diseases.
Users can ask permission to subscribe to updates about other users' health status, as new information becomes available.
New information is issued by issuing authorities.
Thus, this repository contains an EndUser contract and an Issuer contract, specifying the two roles.

Although data on Ethereum is currently typically public, this concept assumes the possibility of more private means of data transmission.
This might be accomplished with the Azure protocol, or by yet-to-be-developed means.
